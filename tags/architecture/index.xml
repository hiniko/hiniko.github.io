They are everywhere. I can remember the first time I saw anything like a computer. I have memories of playing the NES at the age of 2.
So as his very mature and responsible uncle, it is my duty to guide his journey in the devices that are shaping our entire lives. Since I have studied and practiced computing for more years than I like to think about, especially when considering how inept I am, I think it is important for him to know what to can do for and to him.</description></item></channel></rss>
