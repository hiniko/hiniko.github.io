The project spec was to create an application to aid new learners in procedural based programming by having them compete for their code.
The application was written in Java and comprised of two parts.
The first was a simple text editor that could compile java byte-code at run-time. The second was a 2D arena based game where the compiled byte-code from multiple users was run.</description></item></channel></rss>
