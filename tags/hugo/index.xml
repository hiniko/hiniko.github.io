They all started as somewhere to blog, take notes and showcase projects. And rather than get on with it, I&amp;rsquo;ve always been distracted by the looks, or the function, or the hosting.
It is then no surprise then that over the years I have very little to show for it. Most of the older sites have been lost to failed hard drives or expired and forgotten about hosting.</description></item></channel></rss>
