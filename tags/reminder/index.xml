I just started another small side project based on a fresh rails 5 setup.
I thought this was a good opportunity to try out a different CSS framework called Bulma, which I saw mentioned on Garry&amp;rsquo;s Blog. Why not? Small projects are great for trying new things.
bulma uses font-awesome but does not package it in their framework, which is fair. They suggest that you use a CDN copy of font-awesome.</description></item></channel></rss>
