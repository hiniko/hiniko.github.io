If you want to have your code properly checked on the version of ruby you are working with, tough. Other wise you can add let g:ruby_path in your .vimrc to configure which ruby build you use. Remember that rvm can change your ruby automatically. so be careful.</description></item><item><title>Setting up Rails 5 self hosted fonts</title><link>https://shermanrose.uk/posts/2017/setting-up-font-awesome-and-rails/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shermanrose.uk/posts/2017/setting-up-font-awesome-and-rails/</guid><description>TL-DR; Get to the point
I just started another small side project based on a fresh rails 5 setup.
I thought this was a good opportunity to try out a different CSS framework called Bulma, which I saw mentioned on Garry&amp;rsquo;s Blog. Why not? Small projects are great for trying new things.
bulma uses font-awesome but does not package it in their framework, which is fair. They suggest that you use a CDN copy of font-awesome.</description></item></channel></rss>
