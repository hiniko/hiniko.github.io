So I decided to help myself out and write a Flash game to help me learn!
Written using Adobe Flash and ActionScript 3, this small program will take you through a quiz of Hiragana and Katakana with the parameters you define.
If you still have flash installed have a go! There are some more screen shots below otherwise!</description></item></channel></rss>
