They all started as somewhere to blog, take notes and showcase projects. And rather than get on with it, I&amp;rsquo;ve always been distracted by the looks, or the function, or the hosting.

So I decided to help myself out and write a Flash game to help me learn!
Written using Adobe Flash and ActionScript 3, this small program will take you through a quiz of Hiragana and Katakana with the parameters you define.
If you still have flash installed have a go!

The project spec was to create an application to aid new learners in procedural based programming by having them compete for their code.
The application was written in Java and comprised of two parts.
