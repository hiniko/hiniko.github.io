Basic Language Usage Basic things to remember while bouncing around languages
Slices / Arrays Arrays exist in Golang and can be created manually:
However, nearly all usages of arrays are through slices, which are built on top of arrays, providing a view into a backing array.
Some things to keep in mind:
Changing a value in a slice changes the value in the backing array Ranges can be used on slices: slice[1:5], slice[:2], slice[2:] A slice can be resized to reflect more or less of the underlying array, through assignment: slice = slice[:cap(slice)] Resizing a slice past the capacity of the array will throw a panic Compose Literals You can define an array of basic types use a compose literal like so:</description></item><item><title/><link>https://shermanrose.uk/knowledge/programming/golang/testing-stdin-stdout/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shermanrose.uk/knowledge/programming/golang/testing-stdin-stdout/</guid><description>I needed to test the input and output of a cli program I was writing.
I needed to capture what was happening in a goroutine safe way so I ended up with the struct below.
Anywhere that did logging was passed this struct as their io.Writer
It has a lock as testing with -race complained (rightly) at multiple routines trying to access at once. This would also help ensure that messages were output in full, without interference from other write calls</description></item><item><title>Golang - Types</title><link>https://shermanrose.uk/knowledge/programming/golang/go-types/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shermanrose.uk/knowledge/programming/golang/go-types/</guid><description>Structs Basics Similar to C/C++, you can declare custom types :
1 2 3 type Tuple struct { X, Y, Z, W float64 } You can also declare an alias to a type:
1 2 3 type Foo String var bar Foo = &amp;#34;FooString&amp;#34; However, it is essential to note that Foo and string are now two different types. Since 1.9, you are able to tell the compiler that a type alias is just another name but should be considered the same type overall.</description></item><item><title>golang - Using and testing `flag`</title><link>https://shermanrose.uk/knowledge/programming/golang/using-and-testing-flag/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shermanrose.uk/knowledge/programming/golang/using-and-testing-flag/</guid><description>Setting up flags in init 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 package main import ( &amp;#34;flag&amp;#34; &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; &amp;#34;testing&amp;#34;) var flagDebug bool var flagHost string func init() { flag.BoolVar(&amp;amp;flagDebug, &amp;#34;debug&amp;#34;, false, &amp;#34;enable debug output&amp;#34;) flag.StringVar(&amp;amp;flagHost, &amp;#34;host&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;example.com&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;set the host to connect to&amp;#34;) flag.Parse() } func TestFlags(t *testing.T) { fmt.Println(flagDebug) fmt.Println(flagHost) } func TestFlagsAgain(t *testing.</description></item><item><title>Testing in Golang</title><link>https://shermanrose.uk/knowledge/programming/golang/go-testing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shermanrose.uk/knowledge/programming/golang/go-testing/</guid><description>Table Driven Tests Asserting with Testify Testing Suites Testing Env Vars Update Testing flag Table Driven Tests Table-driven tests format your tests to ensure that you are as DRY as possible while making it easy to add more test cases.
