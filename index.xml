They all started as somewhere to blog, take notes and showcase projects. And rather than get on with it, I&amp;rsquo;ve always been distracted by the looks, or the function, or the hosting.
It is then no surprise then that over the years I have very little to show for it. Most of the older sites have been lost to failed hard drives or expired and forgotten about hosting.</description></item><item><title>Numbers Game</title><link>https://shermanrose.uk/projects/numbers_game/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shermanrose.uk/projects/numbers_game/</guid><description>Numbers is small game, where you attempt to reach the target number by adding or subtracing a combination of numbers to reach it.

This is causing havoc with trying to use shortcodes. That explains why I have had no luck using the &amp;lt; &amp;gt; code format over the % % format. I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to do that rewrite I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to do, as I&amp;rsquo;m not interested in learning Rust right now.

The issue is that I started an app with CLI features that were useful during testing but didn&amp;rsquo;t make sense when an HTTP rest API was later added and targeted as the primary use case.
Supporting both usages became expensive as testing and new features were burdened by the need to keep functionality consistent across the two APIs.</description></item><item><title>June 29th, 2022</title><link>https://shermanrose.uk/notes/2022/june-29th-2022/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shermanrose.uk/notes/2022/june-29th-2022/</guid><description>golang testing Finding flakey tests Using teststat https://github.com/vearutop/teststat `go test -count 5 -race -json ./&amp;hellip; | teststat - 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Metrics: map[cont:2 data_race:2 fail:6 flaky:6 output:826 pass:159 run:165 slow:100] Elapsed: 7m5.169999999s Slow: 7m3.559999999s Test time distribution (seconds): [ min max] cnt total% sum (165 events) [ 0.00 0.00] 35 21.21% 0.00 .....................

The project spec was to create an application to aid new learners in procedural based programming by having them compete for their code.
The application was written in Java and comprised of two parts.
The first was a simple text editor that could compile java byte-code at run-time. The second was a 2D arena based game where the compiled byte-code from multiple users was run.</description></item><item><title>Sherman Rose</title><link>https://shermanrose.uk/about/sherman/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shermanrose.uk/about/sherman/</guid><description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Sherman!
I write and work on programs for a living.
When I&amp;rsquo;m not doing that, I&amp;rsquo;m probably making music or playing games.
I could go on but why don&amp;rsquo;t you have a look around the site to see more of what I have been up to.

Basic Language Usage Basic things to remember while bouncing around languages
Slices / Arrays Arrays exist in Golang and can be created manually:
However, nearly all usages of arrays are through slices, which are built on top of arrays, providing a view into a backing array.
Some things to keep in mind:
Changing a value in a slice changes the value in the backing array Ranges can be used on slices: slice[1:5], slice[:2], slice[2:] A slice can be resized to reflect more or less of the underlying array, through assignment: slice = slice[:cap(slice)] Resizing a slice past the capacity of the array will throw a panic Compose Literals You can define an array of basic types use a compose literal like so:</description></item><item><title/><link>https://shermanrose.uk/knowledge/programming/golang/testing-stdin-stdout/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shermanrose.uk/knowledge/programming/golang/testing-stdin-stdout/</guid><description>I needed to test the input and output of a cli program I was writing.
I needed to capture what was happening in a goroutine safe way so I ended up with the struct below.
Anywhere that did logging was passed this struct as their io.Writer
It has a lock as testing with -race complained (rightly) at multiple routines trying to access at once. This would also help ensure that messages were output in full, without interference from other write calls E The only other concern was that as it was a buffered output, you need to call flush before getting a string of the output to compare.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://shermanrose.uk/knowledge/programming/java/java-ffmpeg/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shermanrose.uk/knowledge/programming/java/java-ffmpeg/</guid><description>#Audio / Video Library Notes
##BSD CLI wrapper for FFMPEG: https://github.com/bramp/ffmpeg-cli-wrapper

Code Notes LibraryDB seems to be file type agnostic LibraryFile seems to have a lot of image specific calls Worth breaking up in to various child classes of LibraryFile, or using enums to distinguish type?

I just started another small side project based on a fresh rails 5 setup.
I thought this was a good opportunity to try out a different CSS framework called Bulma, which I saw mentioned on Garry&amp;rsquo;s Blog. Why not? Small projects are great for trying new things.
bulma uses font-awesome but does not package it in their framework, which is fair. They suggest that you use a CDN copy of font-awesome.</description></item><item><title>Talk To Me - A 'Simple' Side Project</title><link>https://shermanrose.uk/posts/2017/talk-to-me-a-simple-side-project/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shermanrose.uk/posts/2017/talk-to-me-a-simple-side-project/</guid><description>I have a 3 year old nephew, who loves comptuers, and why shouldn&amp;rsquo;t he?

It communicates with the Asset Register, the system used by the editor to know of all of the assets available, which is in turn used by the Cooker.
