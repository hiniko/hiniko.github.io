Slices / Arrays Arrays exist in Golang and can be created manually:
However nearly all usages of arrays are through slices, which are built on top of arrays, providing a view in to a backing array.
Some things to keep in mind:
Changing a value in a slice changes the value in the backing array Ranges can be used on slices: slice[1:5], slice[:2], slice[2:] A slice can be resized to reflect more or less of the underlaying array, through assignment: slice = slice[:cap(slice)] Resizing a slice past the capacity of the array will throw a panic Compose Literals You can define an array of basic types use a compose literal like so:</description></item><item><title>Golang - Types</title><link>https://shermanrose.uk/knowledge/programming/golang/go-types/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shermanrose.uk/knowledge/programming/golang/go-types/</guid><description>Structs Basics Similar to C/C++, you can declare custom types :

Since 1.9, you are able to tell the compiler that a type alias is just another name but should be considered the same type overall.</description></item><item><title>Hosting on Github</title><link>https://shermanrose.uk/posts/2016/hosting-on-github/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shermanrose.uk/posts/2016/hosting-on-github/</guid><description>I thought I would give hosting a personal website on Github for a change.

bulma uses font-awesome but does not package it in their framework, which is fair.

A great article detailing the setup of the Camera Manager in Unreal and example code for setting up modifiers https://github.com/DaedalicEntertainment/third-person-camera UCameraModifer has a number of functions that can be overwritten in order to change the camera
ProcessViewRotation allows you to make changes to the AController&amp;rsquo;s Control totaiton which represents the &amp;rsquo;true aim&amp;rsquo; view. This can be used for effects like making the character look at a Point of Interest or for things like aim correction / snapping.</description></item><item><title>Unreal - Coding Standards</title><link>https://shermanrose.uk/knowledge/unreal/ue-coding-standards/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shermanrose.uk/knowledge/unreal/ue-coding-standards/</guid><description> UE4 C++ Coding Standards Comments Epic use a modified Doxygen for unreal https://answers.unrealengine.com/questions/77297/what-tool-does-epic-use-for-generating-api-documen.html Doxygen hope pages for sepcial coments commands https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/commands.html#cmdsa</description></item><item><title>Unreal - Config Variables</title><link>https://shermanrose.uk/knowledge/unreal/ue-config-vars/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shermanrose.uk/knowledge/unreal/ue-config-vars/</guid><description> Config Variables You can create custom Client and Server vars as feature or testing switches.

Delegates can be Broadcast by anyone where as events can only be broadcast by the owner Only DYNAMIC_MULTICAST_DELEGATES can be accesed from Blueprints. Non dynamic delegates are event are code only forms
This is due to the need to call the delgate by name DYNAMIC_MULTICAST_DELEGATES are said to be slower, which would makes sense considering the level of indirection needed to call from blueprint.</description></item><item><title>Unreal - Editor notes</title><link>https://shermanrose.uk/knowledge/unreal/ue-editor/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shermanrose.uk/knowledge/unreal/ue-editor/</guid><description> Unreal Editor Settings to note Full performance when not in focus. - use less cpu Useful most of the time, but at times a killer, find it in Editor Preferences -&amp;gt; Miscellaneous -&amp;gt; Use Less CPU when in background</description></item><item><title>Unreal - Enums</title><link>https://shermanrose.uk/knowledge/unreal/ue-enums/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shermanrose.uk/knowledge/unreal/ue-enums/</guid><description>Enums Enum Scoping Never use unscoped enums, as values can clash with predefined eums Use enum class / enum struct instead: I have had a warning that scroped classes only support uint8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 UENUM(BlueprintType) enum class ETabBreadcrumb : uint8 { None, ThingA, ThingB } Getting the enum name from a value: UEnum::GetValueAsString(value); Returns an FString, so when logging make sure to dereference!

Sequences are the name for the timeline utilities. From cutscenes to looping event&amp;rsquo;s animations.
Cameras From my observations working with cameras and sequences. (4.26)
Creating Cine Camera Actor cameras does add them to the level, however (in PIE at least), they are recreated and deleted on demand. (Currently not sure how this plays with Dollys and cranes). Referencing any other Camera manually a placed causes and error when saving the sequence that it contains referneces to an external level.</description></item><item><title>Unreal - UI and Widgets</title><link>https://shermanrose.uk/knowledge/unreal/ue-ui/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shermanrose.uk/knowledge/unreal/ue-ui/</guid><description>UI, Widgets and stuff Creating Widgets in Code Simple Tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYfXkxlInVIuuukjA Nagivation of UI Unreal has a built in system that can handle basic navigation types.
