All points are listed below.\n#todo - Sort these out in to sections\n Using a dynamic camera when another approach would work. Designing levels and camera behaviors that don\u0026rsquo;t match. Using global coordinates or quaternions to persist camera state. Using a default camera distance that\u0026rsquo;s likely to break line-of-sight. Allowing obstacles to break line-of-sight from the side. Pushing the camera away from an obstacle while the player is trying to swing the camera towards it. Letting the player push the camera inside an obstacle. Letting independent forces compete to push the camera. Excessively moving the camera to prevent unimportant items from breaking line-of-sight. 1.: Letting the camera intersect narrow columns. Interpreting a hill as a wall to be avoided. Swinging the camera sideways when occluders come from behind. Letting the camera\u0026rsquo;s near-clipping-plane intersect the avatar. Using the same camera distance for all angles. Using the same field-of-view for worm\u0026rsquo;s eye angles and standard angles. Shifting pitch, distance, and field-of-view independently. Not cutting when the avatar passes through opaque objects. Letting cuts remap directional controls. Breaking the player\u0026rsquo;s sense of direction. Violating the 180 degree rule. Focusing only on the avatar. Relying on players to control the camera all the time. Leaving the camera yaw alone while the player is running. Making it hard to judge distances, Looking straight ahead as the avatar approaches a cliff. Keeping the camera level when the avatar is running on a slope. Misusing the \u0026ldquo;Rule of thirds\u0026rdquo;. Using the same logic for ground and air motion. Relying entirely on procedural camera behaviors. Letting players make themselves lost and confused. Rotating excessively to look at nearby targets. Translating to look at distance targets. Letting the avatar\u0026rsquo;s own body occlude targets ahead. Giving the player control over the camera, and then taking it away. Immediately applying a camera hint after the player finished turning the camera to look at something. Not letting experts explore. Not providing inverted controls. Responding to accidental controller input. Using linear sensitivity. Letting the camera pivot drift too far. Using a too small field-of-view. Rapidly shifting field-of-view. Excessively shaking the camera. Bouncing the camera with the avatar\u0026rsquo;s walk cycle. Translating or rotating up and down when the avatar jumps. Rapidly transitioning to a new camera position. Maintaining pitch speed until hitting the pitch limit. Developing for the Oculus Rift as the primary camera method. Testing with a narrow demographic. Writing a general \u0026ldquo;constraint solver\u0026rdquo; that optimizes for the camera.

The thing I want to always remember is that it is is a rich tool that enables you to orchestrate a number of other programs in to working in tandem.\nFor some this maybe be a given, but for me who wanted to learn to program first and foremost, I would often forget the principal about reinventing the wheel. Most of the the time, the functionality you want already exists, you just need to tie it together in a way that works for you. Imagine that a program is also a set of functions or libraries that I can use and look how much already exists!\nWith this view, I often will write a BASH script over writing in a different language, such as Ruby or Python. However it does breed it\u0026rsquo;s own set of challenges and with anything you end up researching and learning new tricks as well as developing your own styles. In the end, sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s better to just use a different environment to get the job done, but as a tool to start out with and re implement later if needed BASH works quite well.\nSo I think it is about time I started to note down the many facets of BASH that I come across and keep needing to look up whenever I come back to it. Over the next week I will be noting down good pages I have seen that talk about good bash practices as well as noting down some of my own usage and the issues they cause or show.\nStarting out     As BASH is nothing new, there are a lot of articles and resources out there to keep in consideration when writing your scripts and programs. Here is a list of a couple I keep reading and wish I had started out with.\nBASH Best Practices offers a boilerplate of options for bash as well as a couple of style practices to make it easier to find errors in your scripts as well as avoiding pitfalls in variable substitutions. My favourite part of this article are the BASH options repeated here for my own reference:\n#!/bin/bash  set -o errexit # Exit on command errors, fail fast and hard and you will spend less  # time scratching your head about odd errors set -o pipefail # Return the exit status from the last failed piped command  # which can be useful for finding which command in the chain is broken  set -o nounset # Exit when a variable is undeclared. Honestly you are just asking for  # pain if you\u0026#39;re doing this  # Magic variable really feel out of place in bash if you don\u0026#39;t consider it on the same level as other programming languages, but honestly you will be saving time here by using these   # Set magic variables for current file \u0026amp; dir __dir=\u0026#34;$(cd \u0026#34;$(dirname \u0026#34;${BASH_SOURCE[0]}\u0026#34;)\u0026#34; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; pwd)\u0026#34; __file=\u0026#34;${__dir}/$(basename \u0026#34;${BASH_SOURCE[0]}\u0026#34;)\u0026#34; __base=\u0026#34;$(basename ${__file} .sh)\u0026#34; __root=\u0026#34;$(cd \u0026#34;$(dirname \u0026#34;${__dir}\u0026#34;)\u0026#34; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; pwd)\u0026#34; # \u0026lt;-- change this as it depends on your app  arg1=\u0026#34;${1:-}\u0026#34; Defensive BASH Programming tells of techniques to keep your BASH scripts clean and readable, whilst avoiding scoping issues. It has a few tips on formatting plain text and command line parsing, which is an actual pain to get right if you want short and long option styles (-o vs \u0026ndash;option). The most useful parts for me are:\nreadonly FOO=\u0026#34;bar\u0026#34; # Don\u0026#39;t allow this variable to be changed. Can help you not   # make bad decisions  some_function(){  local FOO=\u0026#34;baz\u0026#34; # Use local to ensure that functions do not make global   # changes. Prevents head scratching when odd things   # happen. } And so     I will keep this short and sweet for now. I\u0026rsquo;d rather post about issues as the come up rather than concentrate on writing large and complete articles, if you\u0026rsquo;re interested please checkout the BASH tags for more articles.\n"},{"id":23,"href":"/tags/build-tools/","title":"build tools","parent":"Tags","content":""},{"id":24,"href":"/tags/bytemark/","title":"Bytemark","parent":"Tags","content":""},{"id":25,"href":"/projects/bytemark-dashboards/","title":"Bytemark Dashboards","parent":"Projects","content":"Bytemark Dashboards was a side project to my Customer Support work, to make some information screens to help with properly managing the support queues and jobs that needed to be done.\nOriginally I had stumbled on a piece of software called Dashing.

OK, here we go. I\u0026rsquo;m working using Java now, so of course this means I have to learn a bit more about the build tools and dependacy managers that are out there now.\nAs far as I can see there are really two major contenders out there, maven and gradle. Both of these are combined dependancy managers and build tools each aimed at being \u0026ldquo;THE ONE TRUE WAY\u0026rdquo; of doing things.\nI remember maven from back at uni though I never really understood what it was for and Java developers had a horrible way of making things seem much more complicated than they had to be. Or maybe I was just that ignorant. To be fair, I struggled with ant which is only a build / make like tool written in XML at the time so\u0026hellip; Since then I have used various tools like this in other languages so the concepts are easy these days; it\u0026rsquo;s just a case of learning how to write the files needed to use the tools so lets do that.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t really have good criteria for learning one system over the other. It seems that there are a couple repositories of packaged .jar librires that I can use out there, such as Maven Central, MVN Repository, [bintray\u0026rsquo;s jcenter](https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter.\nSo I am going to make the decision to use gradle based on two things:\n It was suggested to me It doesn\u0026rsquo;t invole writing XML to use  Whilst I am on the topic of build tools how about this for a StackOverflow question?\nPretty much illistrates the point that people keep reinventing wheels left right and center and ultimately make things harder than they have to be in some cases.\nSo! Let\u0026rsquo;s get started with gradle, how hard could it be?\nGetting started with gradle     gradle has a number of guides on their website about how to use it, and even some getting started guides. Great, go read them about 10 times and if you understand how to do anything you think you would know how to do in any other build tool, you\u0026rsquo;re a better person than me (not hard though.)\nIt\u0026rsquo;s probably worth noting I am doing this with direct support for Eclipse IDE. Sod writing Java with vim.\nInstalltion     On all systems the most basic install is download an archive, extracting and then updating your PATH to include the bin/ directory of the extrated archive. A lot like a basic install of ant, so, easy enough.\nIt can be found in macOS package managers such as brew and port and hey apparnetly Windows has those too now. Apparently scoop for Windows has grade in it as well.\nPick one and run with it.\nSetting up      Make a new or go into your existing Eclipse project. In a terminal run gradle init. It should start a deamon for you, which I hear speeds things up for you during development as it\u0026rsquo;s probably caching some project state between calls to try and speed up your day to day tasks. Observe all of the files that have now now appaeraed. Now is a good time to add all of that to your version control of choice. In other words git commit time.  That is about it for the basic setup process. It is worth noting, tha that a file called gradlew is created. This is a standalone wrapper script designed to make it easy for anyone who hasn\u0026rsquo;t yet install the supposed magic that is this build system to do so, simply by running a gradle command as you ususally would through it. It will grab and extract the gradle files and make them work, apparently. Not tested it yet.\nbuild.gradle     Right so now we look in the build file itself. If you used the generator you will find that there is a lovely boilerplate made for you, which is enough to get any project started, or at least to give you a small idea of how to intergrate it into an existing project.\nThe first thing you should notice is that rather than using XML it uses a DSL written in Groovy (something I really should look at one day I guess) to express the tasks, plugins, and dependancies you need in this project. It looks like basic code though so hopefully this is going to be easy.\nComment out all of the guff and lets get into this.\nPulgins     The first thing to note when you start using gradle is that everything is based around plugins. That is to say, gradle is actually a multi purpose build tool with no language specicics dictating it\u0026rsquo;s defualt use. However since it is mostly associated with java projects, the generated build file does by default have the java plugin. More can be read on the java projects tutorial, but is is safe to say that all of the tools needed to compile, test, build and package java projects are contained from within this plugin, so this one is a must in my case.\nBy adding the Eclipse plugin to the build file, it will also allow gradle to manage the .project file that is used by Eclipse to specify project settings. The main reason to do this is to automatically update the class path and imported libraries configuration in Eclipse each time you add or update a dependacy in gradle.\nThere are a good few builtins on the plugin front, which can be spied at from the Project page of the docs or in more depths from the user guide. If that doesn\u0026rsquo;t sedate your need to configure the crap out of things, there is also the online plugins community where you can find things like, AWS tools, tools for other JVM langauges like kotlin build process like building .app files for macOS.\nCrazy.\nRepositories     Not much to say here, you can configure where gradle looks for the dependacies you specify. Handy if you have a really tight internal thing going on but, I\u0026rsquo;m sure I will just stick with whatever service seems the most trustworthy and popular. (jcenter is currently the default and apparently mirrors to maven central as well.)\nDependancies     Really this is the main event. How to I list the millons of .jar files I have and also should add to my classpath somehow?\n"},{"id":62,"href":"/tags/javascript/","title":"javascript","parent":"Tags","content":""},{"id":63,"href":"/knowledge/programming/js/","title":"JavaScript","parent":"Programming","content":"Notes on the hot mess of an ecosystem called JS.

If you want to have your code properly checked on the version of ruby you are working with, tough. Other wise you can add let g:ruby_path in your .vimrc to configure which ruby build you use. Remember that rvm can change your ruby automatically. so be careful.\nI run a VIM run-time like most probably do these days. Lots of plugins to make life a joy in my favourite terminal based text editor. I had it set up real nice. Airplane theme, nice modded power-line fonts, syntax checkers, file browsing, better tab and buffer bars, a really nice status bar, lovely colours. The works!\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t want to have to think about your text editor when you trying to work, to the point where it gets aggravating to me really quickly to have to do so. So when opening and saving a file is visibly really, really slow, like multiple seconds slow. It really starts to tick me off.\nThis starting happening to me a few months ago, and oddly it wasn\u0026rsquo;t consistent. I was busy though, so I put off looking at it in depth, again and again. Sometimes it would happen others times it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t. I had started to think it was one of the plugins so this morning I thought I would finally look at it, as it was working on porting a Ruby app from MRI to jruby and it was getting very annoying to wait so long to edit a gem file repeatedly.\nThanks to a quick google, I found that vim has an option --startuptime \u0026lt;file\u0026gt; to dump it\u0026rsquo;s startup timings in to a file! Great!\nFirst let try no file:\n$ vim --startuptime /tmp/vimstartup \u0026lt;snip\u0026gt; 132.137 000.010: --- VIM STARTED --- Oh, sub second loading? That is how it should be!\nNow with a ruby file from this project:\n$ vim --startuptime /tmp/vimstartup config/routes.rb $ cat /tmp/vimstartup \u0026lt;snip\u0026gt; 070.780 000.332: reading viminfo 070.807 000.027: setting raw mode 070.829 000.022: start termcap 070.895 000.066: clearing screen 2351.422 2278.069 2278.069: sourcing /usr/share/vim/vim74/ftplugin/ruby.vim 2352.217 000.456 000.456: sourcing /usr/share/vim/vim74/indent/ruby.vim 2354.229 001.773 001.773: sourcing /usr/share/vim/vim74/syntax/ruby.vim \u0026ldquo;Bloody hell, 2 seconds to clear the screen?

I\u0026rsquo;m using RVM! It switches the version of ruby in the environment depending on which project folder I am in. I am working on a jruby project now. THE JVM TAKES RELATIVELY EONS TO LOAD UP and I am doing it for each open and save.\nLets prove this I ran:\n$ rvm use default (ruby-2.3.3 btw) $ vim --startuptime /tmp/vimstartup $ cat /tmp/vimstartup \u0026lt;snip\u0026gt; 131.720 060.401 060.401: sourcing /usr/share/vim/vim74/ftplugin/ruby.vim \u0026lt;snip\u0026gt; 200.410 000.002: --- VIM STARTED --- Great!\nWhist nice to prove, this doesn\u0026rsquo;t solve the problem. I want my startup times back. I can add let g:ruby_path \u0026lt;path\u0026gt; to my .vimrc in order to load a different ruby, but I lose the ability to check code on the version of ruby I am writing for. Unsure what to do about this right now. I could force the ruby to default before starting vim I guess?

The database was made with a latin1 charset in the age of emoji. Sorry I mean Unicode. Should be easy enough to fix. You quickly find out that you want to use the charset utf8mb4 and the collation utf8_unicode_ci for you database / tables / columns, in order to take full advantage how most text is stored today.\nWhat about Postgres?     This may have been a good chance to migrate over to PostgreSQL. There are a lot of good things about it being more useful in a lot more cases, what with it being an Object Relational Data Store, having great GIS extentions, It even has an internal Event system you can hook into (LISTEN / NOTIFY) and a lot mroe mature HSTORE for JSON object storage. In this one project the LISTEN / NOTIFY commands would be killer.\npgloader is a recommended tool for making this kind of move. It didn\u0026rsquo;t take much to setup and seemed to copy most of all the data over without too much issue. There were complaints about a couple of keys but that looked like a table order issue, it didn\u0026rsquo;t take the \u0026ldquo;parent\u0026rdquo; key table first before then trying to remake the FKs for the other table. Easy fix if anything.\nHowever it became very apprently very quickly that changing our code base to use PostgreSQL in place of MySQL was going to be a lot more effort then I can justify putting in on my own. We don\u0026rsquo;t use JOOP or something similar to write abstracted SQL and of course MySQL is too non-ANSI in places.\nOnline Schema Migration     At least 8 has native JSON columns that and a load of performance improvements. We could set up replication and get that part of the upgrade done no problem. Except of course the real issuse is that our schema is incorrect. It wouldn\u0026rsquo;t take much to just run some ALTER TABLE... commands, however that could block the database for an unknown amount of time.\nThere are a couple of online transactions tools worth mentioning. gh-ost, pt-online-schema-change, and some facebook tools mentioned in gh-ost. gh-ost seemed really good and after getting some spare databases up in order to test out how it works and if it would work for us, I found that at GitHub, they don\u0026rsquo;t use FKs I had actually seen this before it didn\u0026rsquo;t really sink in. Anyway for good reasons, gh-ost doesn\u0026rsquo;t like working on tabkes with FKs I don\u0026rsquo;t really trust Perconas tools on a mysql database and of course mysql doesn\u0026rsquo;t really give you much in the way on online schema changing either.\nIt seems I\u0026rsquo;m going to have to investigate the offline route now. What I really want to be able to do is copy over the data, alter it to the new charset and then be able to replicate back up to the latest data from master.\nThought it worth nothign down some of what I have seen though\n"},{"id":86,"href":"/categories/personal/","title":"personal","parent":"Categories","content":""},{"id":87,"href":"/categories/personal_log/","title":"personal_log","parent":"Categories","content":""},{"id":88,"href":"/tags/phaser/","title":"phaser","parent":"Tags","content":""},{"id":89,"href":"/knowledge/databases/postgres/postgres/","title":"Postgres - General Notes","parent":"PostgreSQL","content":"Genreal Notes About PostgreSQL     "},{"id":90,"href":"/knowledge/databases/postgres/","title":"PostgreSQL","parent":"Databases","content":"The PostgreSQL database\n"},{"id":91,"href":"/knowledge/databases/postgres/postgres-database-management/","title":"PostgreSQL - Database Managment","parent":"PostgreSQL","content":"PostgreSQL Database Managment      create schema teamcity authorization teamcity;

Get to the point\nI just started another small side project based on a fresh rails 5 setup.\nI thought this was a good opportunity to try out a different CSS framework called Bulma, which I saw mentioned on Garry\u0026rsquo;s Blog. Why not? Small projects are great for trying new things.\nbulma uses font-awesome but does not package it in their framework, which is fair. They suggest that you use a CDN copy of font-awesome. Now, in production I may do such a thing, but:\n  I want to be able to develop offline. There is nothing worse than refreshing a page and it looks like crap because you are in a tunnel on the train.\n  This side project needs to be self hosted so I want to vendor the library rather than rely on CDN\u0026rsquo;s\n  A weak reason, but I remember reading an article I can\u0026rsquo;t find about just how much meta-data is sniffed and compiled about users of CDN\u0026rsquo;s. You can\u0026rsquo;t escape it normally, but why add to it. Looks for tin hat\n  OK! Download Bulma and Font-Awesome extract them into the relevant app/assets in my rails app, and start writing the layout template.\nIt was at this point that I hit the issue that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t see any fonts from font-awesome. The inspector told me that the resources were getting 404 and rails told me no such routes existed.\nAlright then I must be doing something wrong. Actually as rails has a complex assets system using sprockets there are a couple more steps that involve editing the .css files of font awesome.\n\n  Create the folder app/assets/fonts and place your fonts in there.\n  Edit config/application.rb and add config.assets.paths \u0026lt;\u0026lt; Rails.root.join(\u0026quot;app\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;assets\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;fonts\u0026quot;). This will add the new fonts folder to the assets system, which will allow them to be served.\n  Rename font-awesome.css to font-awesome.css.erb. This will allow the file to be processed for erb snippets.\n  Edit the css file, changing all paths to the fonts to erb snippets using rails helpers to inject the correct path there: (or just copy and paste this below:\n  src: url(\u0026#39;\u0026lt;%= asset_path(\u0026#34;fontawesome-webfont.eot\u0026#34;) %\u0026gt;\u0026#39;); src: url(\u0026#39;\u0026lt;%= asset_path(\u0026#34;fontawesome-webfont.eot\u0026#34;) + \u0026#34;?#iefix\u0026#34; %\u0026gt;\u0026#39;) format(\u0026#39;embedded-opentype\u0026#39;), url(\u0026#39;\u0026lt;%= asset_path(\u0026#34;fontawesome-webfont.woff2\u0026#34;) %\u0026gt;\u0026#39;) format (\u0026#39;woff2\u0026#39;), url(\u0026#39;\u0026lt;%= asset_path(\u0026#34;fontawesome-webfont.woff\u0026#34;) %\u0026gt;\u0026#39;) format(\u0026#39;woff\u0026#39;), url(\u0026#39;\u0026lt;%= asset_path(\u0026#34;fontawesome-webfont.ttf\u0026#34;) %\u0026gt;\u0026#39;) format(\u0026#39;truetype\u0026#39;), url(\u0026#39;\u0026lt;%= asset_path(\u0026#34;fontawesome-webfont.svg\u0026#34;) + \u0026#34;#fontawesomeregular\u0026#34; %\u0026gt;\u0026#39;) format(\u0026#39;svg\u0026#39;); Restart your rails server and hey, you should have font.

They are everywhere. I can remember the first time I saw anything like a computer. I have memories of playing the NES at the age of 2.\nSo as his very mature and responsible uncle, it is my duty to guide his journey in the devices that are shaping our entire lives. Since I have studied and practiced computing for more years than I like to think about, especially when considering how inept I am, I think it is important for him to know what to can do for and to him.\nThis somewhat haphazardly brings us to a great idea that I had one day whilst babysitting him and his smaller sister.\nText to Speech engines are magic     I mean, I don\u0026rsquo;t know how they work and whilst they sound funny to most, they are pretty understandable. Realising that macOS has it\u0026rsquo;s own built in engine, that can be called over the command line with say lead to the a good hour worth of having a 3 year old talk to a computer. He treated the computer as a normal person, telling it his wants and asking it questions as he would have any other person he met. His excitement that he could do so made me want to be able to get the computer to talk to him in a way that didn\u0026rsquo;t involve me clunky typing in a terminal window next to him.\nHey! I\u0026rsquo;m a programmer right? Shelling out to the say command isn\u0026rsquo;t really that hard in Ruby! Lets do it!\nAnd so, another Ruby project is born     Talk to me is a very simple project in essence. Run a web server on the host mac, connect to it with a phone or laptop and type what you want the computer to say and in what voice you want it to say it in.\nThis really could be achieved in a simple, POST form data, shell to say in the controller, reload input page and carry on fashion. However what do I really learn from that? No. This is a great time to overcomplicate matters and make life as hard as it can be.\nSo with that in mind what I plan is this. A single page web app, that only allows one user at a time to post messages with live feedback about when the say process is finished.\nIt shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be too hard. Rails has a Web Socekts framework called Action Cable, which works as a pub/sub redis backed communications layer. It also have first class support for background jobs as well, also redis backed. So I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure I can do this and do it quickly!\nFor the front end this sounds like the perfect opportunity to get on the react train. I already know from experience that AngularJS is just confusing in my head in places. So it\u0026rsquo;s time to see what people are making the fuss over.\nI will probably be posting about this project as I get along with it. So, Lets have fun.

For the last 13 years at least I have been very interested in computers and programming in general. I now could not imagine what I would be doing now if it were not for these devices that live in almost every aspect of my life.\nStill I haven\u0026rsquo;t really done much with that, as far as I am concerned. I have made no great websites, services, products, or games. Side projects I may have worked on continuously come to nothing. My will has been eroded to the point where I am not sure if I can even use a computer anymore.\nWhy am I doing this anymore? Why did I get into computing in the first place?\nI wanted to make games     It\u0026rsquo;s pretty simple really. I have always wanted to make a living making video games. I grew up on consoles such ask the NES, Master System, Mega Drive, Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, the DS, Game Gear, The PlayStation. All I ever wanted to do was create content for these systems.\nThen as I got a bit older, PCs were becoming more accessible, and I got to see my family start building computers, getting the latest graphics card they could get the hands on, and playing PC games. DOOM, Age of Empires, Unreal, Civilisation, Populous, Settlers to name some. I remember the Microsoft Entertainment pack games when I was first staring at Windows 3.1, Railroad Tycoon played in DOS. Around the time my mother built me my first PC Roller-coaster Tycoon was out and I spend t a lot of time playing that. In fact I spend most of my childhood playing video games, mostly console games however.\nWhen I was 17 I finally got a more modern PC build that could handle the games of 2007. The Orange Box was out my friends were talking about it, and I would spend the new few months playing rather than studying. I can tell you my grades suffered badly for it, but My want to learn how to program games only increased. This was helped by the rise of the web.\nFlash games were appearing all over the place, Browser based games like Kings of Chaos and Runescape were new and exciting. If you looked at forums you could find smatterings of help about getting started. And so I did. I tried to learn ActionScript 3 in order to get started. I moved on to PHP when the webpage became interesting, HTML / CSS / JavaScript, SQL. I was given a copy of Ubuntu Linux Hardy Heron, and that started what is now my bread and butter skill.\nI went to university, hungry to learn how to do all the things I wanted to do. I had to learn Java, I spent a summer trying to make a tower defence Game in C++, I ran a small VPN service at uni to enable people and myself to play PC games online. I made a few things in Flash in it\u0026rsquo;s dying days (one which you can still see here). And of course I played a lot of games. I planned games with friends, dreamed of games to make but I never actually followed through with any of it.\n5 years later and it\u0026rsquo;s safe to say I had forgotten why I even learned anything in the first place.\nConcerns     It\u0026rsquo;s easy to say now that I struggle to do anything with computers. After a breakdown in 2012, I have only used computers to play more games and make money in which to live. I don\u0026rsquo;t really feel any fulfilment about using one. If anything just a lingering but growing dread of having to spend the day on one. I think I should make a game, just to remember what it was that got me here.\nAnd you never know. I may have fun doing so.\n"},{"id":122,"href":"/knowledge/tools/","title":"Tools","parent":"Knowledge","content":"Notes on tools that I can live without\n"},{"id":123,"href":"/knowledge/tools/daily-use/","title":"Tools - Daily Drivers","parent":"Tools","content":"Tools - Software     CLI Tools     git     tmux     brew     pre-commit     shellcheck     powerlevel10k     oh-my-zsh     "},{"id":124,"href":"/tags/typescript/","title":"typescript","parent":"Tags","content":""},{"id":125,"href":"/tags/unit-test/","title":"unit-test","parent":"Tags","content":""},{"id":126,"href":"/tags/university/","title":"university","parent":"Tags","content":""},{"id":127,"href":"/knowledge/unreal/","title":"Unreal","parent":"Knowledge","content":"Notes on using and programming in Unreal\n"},{"id":128,"href":"/knowledge/unreal/ue-asset-manager/","title":"Unreal - Asset Manager","parent":"Unreal","content":"Asset Manager     At a high level, you can use the asset manager to handle loading and unloading of assets at runtime.

(4.26)\n Creating Cine Camera Actor cameras does add them to the level, however (in PIE at least), they are recreated and deleted on demand. (Currently not sure how this plays with Dollys and cranes).  Referencing any other Camera manually a placed causes and error when saving the sequence that it contains referneces to an external level. This may just be for cameras as you are supposed to be able to refer to actors in tracks. Selecting an asset left behind after a PIE session, before the timeline has had a chance to clean up will likely leave a numbered copy of the camera behind. You can not use this and shouldn\u0026rsquo;t. It goes away when you save the level and when playing the the sequence again you should see the real backing object reappear.    Cutscene Blending     Two ways this can be done:\nUsing Events and SetViewTargetWithBlend      Create an event track on the camera itself to be able to fire events in the Sequence Manager. Doing so will create an event with the reference to the camera yo uwant to manage From here you can use the Set View Target With Blend to blend in to the Cine Camera Actor Ensure the change the start and end points of the cut track in order to make sure that camera is not forcably the used before your blend time if over When blending out, make sure to put the blend out event just before the last cut and Importantly ensure to lock the outgoing camera\u0026rsquo;s frame in the blend options. This will stop the camera cutting to an unknown position before the blend starts!  Using the cut track      Much easier and can manage blend curves as expected Hit plus on the camera cuts track and select your actor from the level A little fiddly when it comes to rearranging cuts overall, but worth the hassle complared to manually firing blends. Actors that do not exist before a PIE session can be added during a PIE Session  After the session the track name will become red denoting it wasn\u0026rsquo;t found, however it will appear white again when the actor is spanwed again.
