* \#windows #AD #GPO Domain Group Policy Management
  * Running `gpmgnt.msc` will give you a local editor. Instead run `Group Policy Management` on the Domain Controller itself
  * Nagivate to `Group Policy Objects` from `Forests / Domains / domain.local`
  * Right click the policy / or create new  to open a copy of the group policy editor that is connected to the domain. You will know this as it will show `[DOMAIN.LOCAL]` Policy in the policy title.
  * If you right click a policy, under GPO Status you can set the permission to change it for clients. e.g `User Configurations Settings disabled` Will enforce the domain policy and stop users from being able to customise it.
