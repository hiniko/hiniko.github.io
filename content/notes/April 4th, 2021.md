## Todo

* Spline Based Path Follower #Unreal
  * Is this way the best way, or should it be handled in the movment component?
  * `InterpToMovementComponent` as a good few ideas in there

## Today I learned (Notes)

* \[Runge-Kutta\]\[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods\] intergration, used in physics engines as it is more accurate than Euler intergration. #Maths #Simulation_Programming #Physics_Engies
  * ![Difference between different intergrations](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Runge-kutta.svg/1920px-Runge-kutta.svg.png)
* Curves And Splines. Third Order Polynomial functions that describe interplotated curves #Math #Game_Programming
  * [A Primer on Bézier Curves](https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/[[introduction]])
    * Really good free online book breaking down and describing Bézier Curves
  * [Splines](https://people.cs.clemson.edu/~dhouse/courses/405/notes/splines.pdf)
    * An indepth Paper on Splines, how they work relation to other curves and coding examples (dropboxed under Books)
