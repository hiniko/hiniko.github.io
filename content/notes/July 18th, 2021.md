## Todo

## Today I learned (Notes)

* \#VSCode #golang
  * Had issues with multiple modes in a single workspace. Turns out the language server `gopls` does currently suppport this by default. Casues a lot of import errors, which disables the server pretty much until resolved. While the fix has been in for a while,it doesn't seem to have become the default. To enable experimental support add this snippit to the relevent `settings.json`:

````
  "gopls": {
  
    "buildFlags": [
      "-tags=wireinject"
    ],
    "experimentalWorkspaceModule": true
  },
}
````
