description: Why This Website Is On Github

I thought I would give hosting a personal website on Github for a change. Whilst I am perfectly capable of hosting such a site myself, I find that my digital estate is in dire need of a audit and in a lot of cases, fresh starts.

I used to wonder why anyone would host a website on Github, but then I realised that, easy `git` based hosting for free, isn't something you come across every day, so might as well use it while you can. 

I have chosen to use a Jekyll based theme / framework called [Minimal](https://mmistakes.github.io/), which you can find more about on their Github Pages website.

Well that is it for now.
