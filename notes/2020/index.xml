However there is no schema version in the document so it becomes a case of managing endpoints Also the json itself has variable keys, something I think that should be avoided like the plague as it make parsing code of the document a lot more fraught, and more difficult in something strongly typed like java In the end as we are only reading a base file, we can get away with typing the &amp;ldquo;routes&amp;rdquo; part of the schema as a JsonElement to preserve the keys during deserialisation, however under different circumstances&amp;hellip; sysdiagnose Apparently a system level tool that collects data ( including #AASA data apprently) Best way to trigger it now is to assign a single tap Assistive Touch button on the phone that is bound to Analytics.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://shermanrose.uk/notes/2020/february-13th-2020/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shermanrose.uk/notes/2020/february-13th-2020/</guid><description> #unity https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.device-simulator@2.0/manual/index.html Preview packaged for better developing for a mobile by simulating the frame Replaces the usual play mode viewer in the editor</description></item><item><title/><link>https://shermanrose.uk/notes/2020/february-25th-2020/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shermanrose.uk/notes/2020/february-25th-2020/</guid><description>data_structures Checking membership of a large set quickly! Using hashes to set bits in a #bit_vector in order to test if an element may be in a set. This could be used as a filter for more expensive tests to hone down on a positive data set. some of the three filters can be tuned and dialed in for performance / memory constraints and to fit certain data sets.

Making the build process for IOS work after the fact was also a pain in the ass Firstly it uses CocoaPods an app / xCode package manager in order to pull the underlying facebook-ios-sdk packages down however that in it self was not enough to get things godoing Had to install CocoaPods using brew Ensure that the project includes a subproject for the pods in xCode which if you pods installation is missing can happen after a bit of brew link that went away after getting unity to rebuild the ios poroject The package uses clang modules so that had to be enabled as a build option This could be done in xCode however we have a post processing script of as part of the unity build process for the xCode project, (Helpful to look at unity cloud build resources here) and it&amp;rsquo;s better off living there for reproducible builds.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://shermanrose.uk/notes/2020/feburary-2nd-2020/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shermanrose.uk/notes/2020/feburary-2nd-2020/</guid><description>#Software Engineering Engineerring-belieifs What do I believe? https://about.wtf.studio/mondays/ #Creativity #Work java #errors Really interesting failure.
