Any calls to this should fail at runtime.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://shermanrose.uk/notes/2021/april-23rd-2021/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shermanrose.uk/notes/2021/april-23rd-2021/</guid><description>Todo Single camera via camera manager in UE4 Today I learned (Notes) ue-editor
Having custom editor only objects appear is quite a task overall
CameraComponent is a good example of how it is done in source code: Engine\UE4\Source\Runtime\Engine\Classes\Camera\CameraComponent.h : 149. This header contains the editor driven functions for creating an managing the proxy mesh that represents the camera positioning in the Blueprint Editor.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://shermanrose.uk/notes/2021/april-8th-2021/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shermanrose.uk/notes/2021/april-8th-2021/</guid><description>Todo ~Investigate mouse capture in unreal~ Investigate missing audio in packaged game Today I learned (Notes) ue-packaging If a file isn&amp;rsquo;t directly reference in editor it will be excludedin cooks / packaged builds.

Promise Chaining JS Promise chaining So it&amp;rsquo;s a little tricky but kinda simple. A then that returns a value, registers a handler that is run after the main promise is resolved. All then that return values like this get the same result A then that rejects or throws calls the first catch handler on all in the promise, defined by order, because JS&amp;hellip; So it&amp;rsquo;s a little tricky but kinda simple.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://shermanrose.uk/notes/2021/july-18th-2021/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shermanrose.uk/notes/2021/july-18th-2021/</guid><description>Todo Today I learned (Notes) #VSCode #golang Had issues with multiple modes in a single workspace. Turns out the language server gopls does currently suppport this by default. Casues a lot of import errors, which disables the server pretty much until resolved. While the fix has been in for a while,it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to have become the default. To enable experimental support add this snippit to the relevent settings.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://shermanrose.uk/notes/2021/may-23rd-2022/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shermanrose.uk/notes/2021/may-23rd-2022/</guid><description>Notes For {{date:dddd, MMMM Do YYYY}} This is a great read, needs to be finished howeer #business, #software #development https://sharedphysics.com/everything-is-important/#the-problem</description></item><item><title/><link>https://shermanrose.uk/notes/2021/october-18th-2021/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shermanrose.uk/notes/2021/october-18th-2021/</guid><description>Notes For Monday, October 18th 2021 #TuringComplete Found an early access game (Written in #GoDot) Which allows you to build computers starting at the Logic Gate level, building into a computer and finally creating an assembly language for the machine you create.

To disable: Basically, IdeaVIM reads your ~/.ideavimrc (~/.vimrc pre-v0.35) file and silently ignores any settings it does not understand. Of the bell-related settings, it does not understand :set noerrorbells, but it does understand :set visualbell.</description></item><item><title>April 4th, 2021</title><link>https://shermanrose.uk/notes/2021/april-4th-2021/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shermanrose.uk/notes/2021/april-4th-2021/</guid><description>Todo Spline Based Path Follower #Unreal Is this way the best way, or should it be handled in the movment component?
