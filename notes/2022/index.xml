This is causing havoc with trying to use shortcodes. That explains why I have had no luck using the &amp;lt; &amp;gt; code format over the % % format. I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to do that rewrite I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to do, as I&amp;rsquo;m not interested in learning Rust right now. Further Site Dev Work I found this working on the front page of the site.</description></item><item><title>June 29th, 2022</title><link>https://shermanrose.uk/notes/2022/june-29th-2022/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shermanrose.uk/notes/2022/june-29th-2022/</guid><description>golang testing Finding flakey tests Using teststat https://github.com/vearutop/teststat `go test -count 5 -race -json ./&amp;hellip; | teststat - 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Metrics: map[cont:2 data_race:2 fail:6 flaky:6 output:826 pass:159 run:165 slow:100] Elapsed: 7m5.169999999s Slow: 7m3.559999999s Test time distribution (seconds): [ min max] cnt total% sum (165 events) [ 0.00 0.00] 35 21.21% 0.00 .....................
