This is causing havoc with trying to use shortcodes. That explains why I have had no luck using the &amp;lt; &amp;gt; code format over the % % format. I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to do that rewrite I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to do, as I&amp;rsquo;m not interested in learning Rust right now. Further Site Dev Work I found this working on the front page of the site.</description></item><item><title>September 20th, 2022</title><link>https://shermanrose.uk/notes/2022/september-20th-2022/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shermanrose.uk/notes/2022/september-20th-2022/</guid><description/></item><item><title>August 16th, 2022</title><link>https://shermanrose.uk/notes/2022/august-16th-2022/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shermanrose.uk/notes/2022/august-16th-2022/</guid><description/></item><item><title>July 20th, 2022</title><link>https://shermanrose.uk/notes/2022/july-20th-2022/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shermanrose.uk/notes/2022/july-20th-2022/</guid><description/></item><item><title>July 12th, 2022</title><link>https://shermanrose.uk/notes/2022/july-12th-2022/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shermanrose.uk/notes/2022/july-12th-2022/</guid><description/></item><item><title>July 7th, 2022</title><link>https://shermanrose.uk/notes/2022/july-7th-2022/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shermanrose.uk/notes/2022/july-7th-2022/</guid><description>Golang app architecture I have been writing my first go app at work, which now has pain points in its architecture that make it harder to add new features.
The issue is that I started an app with CLI features that were useful during testing but didn&amp;rsquo;t make sense when an HTTP rest API was later added and targeted as the primary use case.
Supporting both usages became expensive as testing and new features were burdened by the need to keep functionality consistent across the two APIs.</description></item><item><title>June 29th, 2022</title><link>https://shermanrose.uk/notes/2022/june-29th-2022/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shermanrose.uk/notes/2022/june-29th-2022/</guid><description>golang testing Finding flakey tests Using teststat https://github.com/vearutop/teststat `go test -count 5 -race -json ./&amp;hellip; | teststat - 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Metrics: map[cont:2 data_race:2 fail:6 flaky:6 output:826 pass:159 run:165 slow:100] Elapsed: 7m5.169999999s Slow: 7m3.559999999s Test time distribution (seconds): [ min max] cnt total% sum (165 events) [ 0.00 0.00] 35 21.21% 0.00 .....................
