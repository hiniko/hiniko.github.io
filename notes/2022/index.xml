This is causing havoc with trying to use shortcodes. That explains why I have had no luck using the &amp;lt; &amp;gt; code format over the % % format. I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to do that rewrite I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to do, as I&amp;rsquo;m not interested in learning Rust right now. Further Site Dev Work I found this working on the front page of the site.</description></item><item><title>June 6th, 2022</title><link>https://shermanrose.uk/notes/2022/june-6th-2022/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shermanrose.uk/notes/2022/june-6th-2022/</guid><description/></item><item><title>June 3rd, 2022</title><link>https://shermanrose.uk/notes/2022/june-3rd-2022/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shermanrose.uk/notes/2022/june-3rd-2022/</guid><description/></item><item><title>June 1st, 2022</title><link>https://shermanrose.uk/notes/2022/june-1st-2022/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shermanrose.uk/notes/2022/june-1st-2022/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
